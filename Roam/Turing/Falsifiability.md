  * Is a standard of evaluation of scientific theories and hypotheses that was introduced by the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] in his book *The Logic of Scientific Discovery*
  * According to Popper the **demarcation criterion** for distinguishing science from pseudo-science.
  * The problem with *falsifiability* is that Kuhn and [[Lakatos]] show taht scientists do not reject but try to rescue theories in the face of falsifying evidence, by constructing **ad-hoc hypotheses**
  * ## Prior terms
    * *Verification*
      * Is assessing the fit between a theory and empirical facts.
    * *Confirmation*
      * Is showing a statement to be supporting by empirical evidence. With induction only we can a degree of support. Therefore, a theory can only be *corroborated*, but can never be confirmed conclusively
    * *Falsification*
      * Is showing a statement to be **false**. A state or theory can be proved wrong with absolute certainty. According to [[Karl Popper]], a theory is to be rejected when predictions derived from it turn out to be false. A theory can **never** be verified, but it can conclusively be falsified.
      * Criticism
      * Anti-Dogmatism
    * **Scientific progress** can be made only by advancing bold, improbable conjectures, and then ruthlessly trying to falsify them.
