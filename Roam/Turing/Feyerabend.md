  * Paul Feyarabend (1978), his position has become known as *methodological anarchism*
  * Has radicalized Kuhn's relativism.
  * There is and should be no demarcation criterion. the quest of demarcation is disastrous to scientific progress. Methodological rules hamper progress, choosing the unjustified and unconfirmed, is the road to new discoveries.
  * Framing hypotheses which go against established theories is the way science proceeds.
  * Big science is succesful because it controls the resources to churn out ever more results that confirm it. From the competition the lack of confirmation is in this view no disadvanage
  * ' anything goes' means that no hypothesis should be rejected as falsified or unconfirmed.
  * Scientific progress, rather than being the epitome of rationality, needs a firm dose of irrationality.
  * Feyerabend does not recognize the distinction between context of discovery and context of justification. 
  * A realization: He couln't answer the rather crucial question:
    * Why is it that established science has delivered such impressive results, and alchemy, voodoo and witchcraft have not?
    * What is the distinction between the former from the latter?
