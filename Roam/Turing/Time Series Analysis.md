# Characteristics of Time Series
Due the nature of data observed at different points in time leads to problems in statistical modeling and inference.
The obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the **assumption** that these adjacent observations are **independent and identically distributed**. The systematic approach by which one goes about answering the mathematical and statistical questions posed by these time correlations is commonly referred to as **time series analysis**.
New and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference are caused by the analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time. Modeling a future value of a time series as a function of the current and past values is what the time domain approach focuses on. The primary characteristics of interest in time series analyses relate to periodic or systematic sinusoidal variations found naturally in most data. Periodic variations can be caused by biological, physical, or environmental phenomena.
## The Nature of Time Series Data
## Time Series Statistical Models
In order to provide a statistical setting for describing the character of data that seemingly fluctuates in a random fashion over time, we assume a time series can be defined as a collection of random variables. A collection of random variables, $x_t$, is referred to as a stochastic process. A sample time series can be graphically displayed by Plotting the values of the random variables on the vertical axis, or ordinate, with the time scale as the Abscissa.
