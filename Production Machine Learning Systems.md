# Architecting production ML systems
## Quiz 
* What percent of system code does the ML model account for?
	* 5%
* In the featurestore, the timestamps are an attribute of the feature values, not a separate resource type
	* True
* Match the three of data ingest with an appropriate source of training data
	* Streaming (Pub/Sub), structured batch (BigQuery), unstructured batch (Cloud Storage)
* Which type of training do you use if your data set doesn't change over time?
	* Static training
* [[Vetex AI]] has a unified dat preparation tool that supports image, tabular, text, and video content. Where are uploaded datasets stored in [[Vertex AI]]?
	* A [[Google Cloud Storage]] bucket that acts as an input for both [[AutoML]] and custom training jobs.
* Which type of logging should be enabled in the online prediction that logs the stderr and stdout streams from your prediction nodes to [[Cloud Logging]] and can be useful for debugging?
	* Container loggin
* When you use the data to train a model, [[Vertex AI]] examines the source data type and feature values and infers how it will use that feature in model training. This is called the ______ for that feature.
	* Transformation
# Designing adaptable ML systems
## Quiz
* Suppose you are building an ML-based system to predict the likelihood that a customer will leave a positive review. The user interface that customers leave reviews on changed a few months ago, but you don't know about this. Which of these is a potential consequence of mismanaging this data dependency?
	* Losses in prediction quality
* What is the shift in the actual relationship between the model inputs and the output called?
	* Concept drift
* Which of the following models are susceptible too a feedback loop? Check all that apply
	* A university-ranking model that rates schools in part by their selectivity (the percentage of students who applied that were admitted).
		* Correct! The model's rankings may drive additional interest to top-rated schools, increasing the number of applications they receive. If these schools continue to admit the same number of students, selectivity will increase (the percentage of students admitted will go down). This will boost these schools' rankings, which will further increase prospective student interest, and so onâ€¦
	* A book-recommendation model that suggests novels its users may like based on their popularity (i.e., the number of times the books have been purchased).
		* Correct! Book recommendations are likely to drive purchases, and these additional sales will be fed back into the model as input, making it more likely to recommend these same books in the future.
	* A traffic-forecasting model that predicts congestion at highway exits near the beach, using beach crowd size as one of its features.
		* Correct! Some beachgoers are likely to base their plans on the traffic forecast. If there is a large beach crowd and traffic is forecast to be heavy, many people may make alternative plans. This may depress beach turnout, resulting in a lighter traffic forecast, which then may increase attendance, and the cycle repeats.
* What is training skew caused by?
	* Your development and production environments are different, or different code is used in the training environment than in the development environment
		* Correct! Different versions may cause predictions to be significantly slower or consume more memory in the training environment than in the development environment. Different code may result in different performance.
* Which of the following tools help software users manage dependency issues?
	* Maven, Gradle, and Pip
* Gradual drift is used for which of the following?
	* And old concept that incrementally changes to a new concept over a period of time.
* Which component identifies anomalies in training and serving data and can automatically create a schema by examining the data?
	* Data validation
