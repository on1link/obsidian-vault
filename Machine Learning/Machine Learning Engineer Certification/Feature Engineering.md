## Quiz
1. Vertex AI Feature Store provides a centralized repository for organizing, storing, and serving ML features. Using a central featurestore, enables an organization to efficiently share, discover, and re-use ML features at scale, which can increase the velocity of developing and deploying new ML applications. What are the key challenges that Vertex AI Feature Store solves
	* Mitigate data storage silos, which occurs when you might have built and managed separate solutions for storage and the consumption of feature values.
	* Detect drift, as a result of significant changes to your feature data distribution over time
	* Mitigate training-serving skew, which occurs when the feature data distribution that you use in production differs from the feature data distribution that was used to train your model.
2. What is one definition of a feature in machine learning?
	* A value that is passed as input to a model
3. Where are the features registered?

# Raw Data to Features
Feature engineering is often the longest and most difficult phase of building your ML project. In the feature engineering process, you start with your raw data and use your own domain knowledge to create features that will make your machine learning algorithms work. In this module we explore what makes a good feature and how to represent them in your ML model.
## Overview of feature engineering
## Raw data to features
## Good features versus bad features
## Features should be know at prediction-time
## Features should be numeric
## Features should have enough examples
## Bringing human insight
## Representing features

# Feature Engineering

This module reviews the differences between machine learning and statistics, and how to perform feature engineering in both [[BigQuery ML]] and [[Keras]]. We'll also cover some advanced feature engineering practices.
## Machine learning versus statistics

## Basic feature engineering
## Advanced feature engineering: Feature crosses
## Bucketize and Transform Functions
## Temporal and geolocation features
## Quiz
* Which of the following is true about Feature Cross?
	* Feature Cross enables a model to learn separate weights for each  combination of features
	* It is a process of combining features into a single feature.
* What is the significance of ML.FEATURE_CROSS?
	* ML.FEATURE_CROSS generates a STRUCT feature with all combinations of crosses categorical features except for 1-degree items.
* Which of the following statements are true regarding the ML.EVALUATE function?
	* The ML.EVALUATE function evaluates the predicted values against the actual data.
	* The ML.EVALUATE function can be used with linear regression, logistic regression, k-means, matrix factorization, and ARIMA-based time series models.
	* You can use the ML.EVALUATE function to evaluate model metrics.
* What is [[one-hot encoding]]?
	* One-hot encoding is a process by which categorical variables are converted into a form that could be provided to neural networks to do a better job in prediction.
* True or False:  Feature Engineering is often one of the most valuable tasks a data scientist can do to improve model performance, for three main reasons:
	1. You can isolate and highlight key information, which helps your algorithms "focus" on what’s important.
	2. You can bring in your own domain expertise.
	3. Once you understand the "vocabulary" of feature engineering, you can bring in other people’s domain expertise.
* What do you use the tf.feature_column.bucketized_column function for?
	* To discretize floating point values into a smaller number of categorical bins
* What is a feature cross?
	* A feature cross is a synthetic feature formed by multiplying (crossing) two or more features. Crossing combinations of features can provide predictive abilities beyond what those features can provide individually.
* Which of the following statements are true regarding the ML.BUCKETIZE function?
	* It bucketizes a continuous numerical feature into a string feature with bucket names as the value
	* ML.BUCKETIZE is a pre-processing function that creates buckets by returning a STRING as the bucket name after numerical_expression is split into buckets by array_split_points.
# Preprocessing and Feature Creation
In this module you will learn more about Dataflow, which is a complementary technology to Apache Beam and both of them can help you build and run preprocessing and feature engineering.
