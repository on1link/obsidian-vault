Introduction to MLOps tools and best practices for deploying, evaluating, monitoring and operating production ML systems on Google Cloud

MLOps is a discipline focused on the deployment, testing, monitoring, and automation of ML systems in production.

Machine Learning professionals use tools for continuous improvement and evaluation of deployed models.

The concept of Machine Learning Operations and the considerations behind it 

# Employing Machine Learning Operations
## Why and when to employ MLOps

Why: To shorten the development lifecycle of systems and ensure that high quality software is continuously developed, delivered, and maintained in production
## Machine Learning (ML) practitioners' pain points
Practitioners:
	ML practitioner is used to describe all these different roles throughout the ML lifecycle
Paint point from ML practitioners
* Keeping track of different versions
	* Models and code
	* Data, model architectures
* Controlling the experiment space
	* Different training procedure parameters
	* Hyperparameter values in each trial
	* Performance metrics control
	*  Changes being made
	* Ideas are being tried
		* Which work and which don't
* Pin-pointing the best-performing model
		The best model here refers to the one that delivers the ideal result for the specific use case.
		
* Collaborating
	* With Data Scientist, Data Engineers, ML Engineers, App Devs, site reliability engineers, business analysts and business users in operationalizing the ML models.

* There is the matter of reprodu

## Quiz
* Which of the following characteristics of delivering an ML model is considered as a characteristic of maturity level 0?
	* Manual, script-driven, and interactive process
* Which of the following steps is part of continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) but not continuous training (CT)?
	* Building the model
* What is the important aspect of MLOps which differs from DevOps?
	* MLOps constantly monitors, retrains, and serves the model.
* What is the process of monitoring, measuring, retraining, and serving ML models automatically and continuously to adapt to changes in the data before they're redeployed?
	*  Continuous Training
