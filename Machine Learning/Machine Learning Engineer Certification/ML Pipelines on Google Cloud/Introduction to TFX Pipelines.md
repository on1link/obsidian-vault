# TFX concepts
## Component
A TFX component is an implementation of the machine learning task in your pipeline.
	They're designed to be modular and extensible.
	With Google's best practices on tasks:
		* Data partitioning
		* Validation
		* Transformation
Each step in the pipeline is a component, produces and consumes **structured data representations** called **artifacts**. This way transfer data between components during the continuous exec of the pipeline.

Components composition:
	Component specification: How the component communicate with each other.
	Component driver: Driver class, coordinates compute job execution.
	Component executor: Executor class, implements the actual code to perform a step of the ML workflow.
	Component interface: Packages the component specification and executer for use in a pipeline.
	Component publisher.
