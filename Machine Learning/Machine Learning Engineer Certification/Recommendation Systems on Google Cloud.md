# Recommendation Systems Overview
## Quiz
* What are some ways you can address the [[cold-start problem]] that can occur for new users of a [[collaborative filter]] recommendation system?
	* Rely on a [[content-based method]] instead for **new users**.
		* Content-based systems require that we either base our recommendations solely on the properties of the items, by looking for similar items for example, or that we have representations of our users in the same embedding space of out items. For a trivial example.
* Suppose you want to build a collaborative filter to suggest new hiking trails for users. The problem is you don't have any good explicit user ratings for trails. What feature might be useful for creating an implicit measure of a user's rating for a trail instead?
